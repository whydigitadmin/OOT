1. VM - IP CHANGED

In Amazon Linux ip address was changed from 54.169.216.28 -> 54.254.131.225.

The APP was not working.

How to resolve.

1. Log in to new ip
2. Build the Angularcode in local and place it in Apache server.
3. Restart the Apache Server.
4. Build the java code in (FACEDE and SERVICE ) BOTH - Mantatory
5. Deploy both services in server. Restart both the services.
6. Generate the CERT file in SERVER.


2. IF Angular is runnign on HTTPS mode then Java app layer (FACADE) also SHOULD run on Https mode.

3. But service layer may run on Http mode
